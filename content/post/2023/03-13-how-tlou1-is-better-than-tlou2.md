Tlou2 is very ambitious,it want to show a more capacious doomsday,more flounderingly to live people.But in fact it make the plot to tear.   
In a hopeless zombie rampaged world,the immersion get by players can use small space,but in tlou2 use more streets,more roads,even ellie's first day in seattle have a open world like map,it make game rhythm slow.  
Tlou2 use two charactars to act the story,we don't argue the story is good or not,to be honest abby is a not charming charactar,she can not give players more attraction.  
Charactar's low attraction is the most destructive for a linear narrative video game.
